# CS178A Project
## Proposal
Study Mates

Description: 
Study Mates is a mobile application with the primary function of helping the user focus on studying using the pomodoro method. A study mate, a pokemon-inspired concept, will be the main motivation to make the user study. The application will keep track of how long the user studies for in total and reward them for longer hours of study through in-game currency to care for their study mate, i.e. buying food. The user can interact with their study mate and be able to play and take care of them like a virtual pet. 

Teammates: 
Gabriela Alvarez, Cindy Do, Megan Miyazaki, Ashley Pham

Tools Used: 
React Native, Firebase/FireStore, Paint Tool Sai

Schedule for Daily Meetings: 10pm

Final Vision: 
The final app will allow the user to adopt/take care of an ingame virtual pet that encourages the user to study. The user will be able to set a weekly study goal they want to achieve. Each study block, the user will be rewarded with coins. Coins can be used to buy cosmetic items or treats for their pet to improve their friendship.

We expect the app to be very heavily focused on its design of the menus, animations, and characters. The graphics of the game will be the main focus and appeal to the user. 

Vision for the End of This Quarter:  
By the end of the quarter, we expect to figure out the basics of app development and start with a barebones app that includes the timer to count studying hours and adding in a few virtual pets.
